PyCTF
=====

PyCTF is a Capture-the-Flag framework.

> IN DEVELOPMENT - Please report any issues or requests through github


Overview
--------

The goal of PyCTF is to provide an easy to setup and use challenge-response game.

The PyCTF Server allows for clients to connect to it to grab questions and media that relate to the questions,
and then submit a response. It allows for unique question/answer combos for each user, which can be generated by nearly any language.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7 or 3.2+ \*
	- bottle

\* Currently in development on 3.4, planning to target 2.7+ 

Optional requirements:

* cherrypy (if using SSL)
* requests (if using python client) 


Basic usage
-----------

To start up a match, simply start off the `pyctf_server.py` python file under the 'src' directory. 

`python pyctf_server.py`

With default settings this will start a server and website running locally on port 47275. 
Access it by opening a web browser (currently tested with firefox) and pointing it to `http://localhost:47275/`. 


> DO NOT use the provided SSL pem when running your own server,
it is provided for demonstration / testing purposes only.
