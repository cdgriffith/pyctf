PyCTF
=====

PyCTF is a Capture-the-Flag framework.

It's goal is to provide an easy to setup and use challenge-response game.

The PyCTF Server allows for clients to connect to it to grab questions and media that relate to the questions,
and then submit a response. It allows for unique question/answer combos for each user, which can be generated by nearly any language.
